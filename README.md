# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Once I got the concept of Bootstrap, I enjoyed this part of the assignment. 

In trying to minimize media queries, I did not use them in this exercise. A media query may have been helpful for the midrange size to resize the headings over the photos. I will continue to experiment with that application. 

I find the responsiveness of bootstrap to be helpful.
